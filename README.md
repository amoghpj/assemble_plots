# assemble_plots
This repository tracks the piece of scilab code that takes the path to a directory containing a set of files in [.xls usually] derived from ImageJ measurements of mean intensities from a time series stack, and creates a superimposed plot with all the specified trends assembled about a specific feature, eg, maximum peak in each plot.
